        Allows us to position an element veritically relative to itself.  This is our way of horizontally aligning the element. 

        This is a bit counter intuitive because you'd think a negative value would push the content down and a positive value would push
        the content up. Apparently, it's the opposite. No idea why.

    rem - a unit of measurement that scales according to the user's default html font size. So if 
    the root font size of the html element is 15px and we 1.5rem, we're saying size = 1.5 * 15.

    It's fairly safe to assume 1rem = 16px when performing calculations to go from pixels to rem.

    From Q & A, lesson 19:

    For &__description, to center the text we use margin-right, margin-left auto? 
    why with text-align:center; it doesn't work. Sorry for asking this

    The margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto center the box containing the text, 
    while the text-align: center center the text inside the box. <p> or the paragraph 
    element is a block level element (the box) and the content it contains is 
    inline (the text inside the box).
