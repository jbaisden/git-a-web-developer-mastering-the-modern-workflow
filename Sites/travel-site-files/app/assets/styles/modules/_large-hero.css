        Allows us to position an element veritically relative to itself.  This is our way of horizontally aligning the element. 

        This is a bit counter intuitive because you'd think a negative value would push the content down and a positive value would push
        the content up. Apparently, it's the opposite. No idea why. The % refers to the total height of the content. So assume
        the content is 90px tall. We're saying push the content up by 45px (see -50%).
