Autoprefixer - tool that changes css styles to the various -webkit-, -moz- prefixes so they don't all have to be typed out.

PostCss - css processor


npm packages - css-loader, style-loader - these allow webpack to understand css files (natively it only supports js files)

B.E.M. - css selectors should target elements directly with classes instead of type selectors
    B - Block - independent reusable part of our design
    E - element belongs to a block & is dependent on the block.
    M - modifier can be used on a block or an element to indicate a change to state ex. --is-open might have a 
    style that opens a hamburger menu.

I am not sure if this is mentioned elsewhere, but a trick mentioned in another course to simplify rem calculations is to set

html{
font-size:62.5%;
}

in the base/global file. This will allow all of your rem calculations to be based on 10 instead of 16, e.g. the design 
file gives you a 32px headline which translates to 3.2rem. It is much quicker to just move the decimal one space.
