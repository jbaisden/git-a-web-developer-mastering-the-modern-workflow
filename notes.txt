Autoprefixer - tool that changes css styles to the various -webkit-, -moz- prefixes so they don't all have to be typed out.

PostCss - css processor


npm packages - css-loader, style-loader - these allow webpack to understand css files (natively it only supports js files)



I am not sure if this is mentioned elsewhere, but a trick mentioned in another course to simplify rem calculations is to set

html{
font-size:62.5%;
}

in the base/global file. This will allow all of your rem calculations to be based on 10 instead of 16, e.g. the design 
file gives you a 32px headline which translates to 3.2rem. It is much quicker to just move the decimal one space.

After changes made in lesson 20, you can view the site from a device on the wifi network
by going to the ip address of the machine running the dev server and port:3000. The page and styles 
will update in real time.

LESSON 21 - MOBILE FIRST 

* Most traffic actually comes from mobile devices
* Code site such that mobile devices load only the content/data needed for 
their form factor

see postcss_notes.txt

What is a responsive image and why do we need it?

2 occasions:

1: Art direction & cropping. Sometimes wider cropped images look strange on mobile devices as it
makes the subject look far away. Generally you want to crop tightly around the subject for mobile
form factors.

In the case where you have distinct images per form factor, use:

<picture>
    <source srcset="image_file" media="(min-width: 1200px)" >
    <source srcset="image_file" media="(min-width: 760px)" >
    <img src="defaultimage.jpg" alt="img description">
</picture>

2: Image resolution & filesize

This allows the device/browser to make the choice about which image to load.
<img srcset="smallimage.jpg 570w, mediumimage.jpg 1200w, largeimage.jpg 1900w">

Example: 

    <picture>
      <source srcset="assets/images/hero--large.jpg 1920w, assets/images/hero--large-hi-dpi.jpg 3840w" media="(min-width: 1380px)">
      <source srcset="assets/images/hero--medium.jpg 1380w, assets/images/hero--medium-hi-dpi.jpg 2760w" media="(min-width: 990px)">
      <source srcset="assets/images/hero--small.jpg 990w, assets/images/hero--hi-dpi.jpg 1980w" media="(min-width: 640px)">
      <img srcset="assets/images/hero--smaller.jpg 640w, assets/images/hero--smaller-hi-dpi.jpg  1280w" alt="Coastal view of ocean and mountains.">
    </picture>
