Autoprefixer - tool that changes css styles to the various -webkit-, -moz- prefixes so they don't all have to be typed out.

PostCss - css processor


npm packages - css-loader, style-loader - these allow webpack to understand css files (natively it only supports js files)



I am not sure if this is mentioned elsewhere, but a trick mentioned in another course to simplify rem calculations is to set

html{
font-size:62.5%;
}

in the base/global file. This will allow all of your rem calculations to be based on 10 instead of 16, e.g. the design 
file gives you a 32px headline which translates to 3.2rem. It is much quicker to just move the decimal one space.

After changes made in lesson 20, you can view the site from a device on the wifi network
by going to the ip address of the machine running the dev server and port:3000. The page and styles 
will update in real time.
